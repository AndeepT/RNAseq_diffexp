# RNA Sequence Analysis for Differential Expression

This project will work through an entire computational pipeline for processing RNA-seq data using command line tools and R including:
1. Inspecting read quality with FASTQC
2. Mapping reads to a reference genome with HISAT2
3. Read counting with HTSEQ-count
4. Differential gene exrpession with EdgeR

Additionally, this project will include an adjacent task of performing RNAseq analysis for isoform expression overview using the MISO pipeline.
